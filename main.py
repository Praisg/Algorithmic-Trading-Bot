"""add the online_trading function that will open trades according to our model forecast.

The online_trading function takes the following arguments:

    symbol - traded symbol
    features - list of features to be used to make forecasts
    model - trained model to be used to make forecasts

Inside the online_trading function, we first connect to the MetaTrader 5 terminal using the path specified in terminal_path. Then we get the current symbol prices using the mt5.symbol_info_tick(symbol) function.

Next, we use our model to predict the signal based on the passed features. If the forecast is positive (more than 0.5), we open a long position, and if the forecast is negative (less than 0.5), we open a short position.

We also set stop loss and take profit for each trade to minimize risks.

If we have already reached the maximum number of open trades (set in the MAX_OPEN_TRADES constant), we do not open new ones and wait until one of the open trades is closed.

If the forecast does not allow us to open a new trade, we also wait until a new signal appears.

At the end of the function, we return the result of the trade execution if it was successfully placed, or None if a trade was not placed."""
